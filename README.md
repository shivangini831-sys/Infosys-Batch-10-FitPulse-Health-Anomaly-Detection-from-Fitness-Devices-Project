# FitPulse: Health Anomaly Detection from Fitness Devices

##  Overview

*FitPulse* is a data analytics and machine learning project designed to detect health anomalies from time-series data generated by wearable fitness devices such as *Fitbit, Apple Watch, and other wearables*. These devices continuously collect biometric and activity-related data that can reveal early warning signs of potential health issues.

This project leverages *time-series analysis, statistical feature extraction, and anomaly detection techniques* to automatically identify unusual health patterns and present meaningful insights through a visualization dashboard. The system aims to support *preventive healthcare, wellness monitoring, and data-driven lifestyle decisions*.
